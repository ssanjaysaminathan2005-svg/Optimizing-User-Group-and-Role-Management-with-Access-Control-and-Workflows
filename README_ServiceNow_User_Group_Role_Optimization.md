# 🧩 Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows in ServiceNow

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **optimizing user, group, and role management** within the **ServiceNow platform** by designing and implementing a robust **access control framework** and **automated workflows**.  
The initiative aims to improve **security**, **compliance**, and **operational efficiency** through **role-based access control (RBAC)**, **workflow automation**, and **integration with identity management systems**.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Streamline **user and group management** within ServiceNow.  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** aligned with organizational policies.  
- Automate **onboarding, offboarding, and access request** workflows.  
- Ensure **security, compliance, and audit readiness**.  
- Enhance **system performance and scalability**.  
- Integrate with **external systems** such as HR and identity management platforms (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
